# Micro Projects

Welcome to my Microprojects Repository! This collection showcases various technical skills I've acquired, each project serving as a practical application of new concepts. I believe that hands-on experimentation is essential for mastering any technology, and these microprojects are my way of deepening my understanding. Each project represents my effort to solidify new knowledge through real-world implementation. Explore the repository to see how I integrate these skills into functional projects.

1. [Predicting Percent Body Fat](https://github.com/eva-butler/Micro_Projects/blob/main/Decision_Tree_Models/body_fat_percentage_predictions.ipynb): In this microproject, I explore the Body Fat Prediction Dataset from Kaggle, which includes measurements from 252 men, such as body density, body fat percentage, age, weight, height, and various circumference metrics. The primary objective is to apply the Decision Tree model using sklearn to predict body fat percentage based on these measurements.
