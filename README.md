# Micro Projects

Welcome to my Microprojects Repository! This collection showcases various technical skills I've acquired, each project serving as a practical application of new concepts. I believe that hands-on experimentation is essential for mastering any technology, and these microprojects are my way of deepening my understanding. Each project represents my effort to solidify new knowledge through real-world implementation. Explore the repository to see how I integrate these skills into functional projects.

1. [Tip Prediction](https://github.com/eva-butler/Micro_Projects/blob/main/Random_Forest_Models/tip_prediction.ipynb): In this microproject, I explore tipping behavior in restaurants. Key features include total bill, tip amount, gender, smoker status, dining day, time, and party size. The goal is to predict the tip amount using a Random Forest model, enhancing my understanding of machine learning applications in real-world scenarios. In this analysis, party size emerged as a key feature, likely due to its correlation with both the total bill and tip amount. The Random Forest model effectively captured these relationships, demonstrating its capability to handle complex interactions within the data. Finally, I was able to show that the Random Forest Model did perform better than the Decision Tree Regression model (1.207 > 0.790).

2. [Predicting Percent Body Fat](https://github.com/eva-butler/Micro_Projects/blob/main/Decision_Tree_Models/body_fat_percentage_predictions.ipynb): In this microproject, I explore the Body Fat Prediction Dataset from Kaggle, which includes measurements from 252 men, such as body density, body fat percentage, age, weight, height, and various circumference metrics. The primary objective is to apply the Decision Tree model using sklearn to predict body fat percentage based on these measurements.
